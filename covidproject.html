      <h1>What Is Covid-19 ?</h1>
      <p class="name">
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
        newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19
        virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
        without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
        underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
        chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
        serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is
        be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how
        it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
        hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
        face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
        discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so
        itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
        example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
